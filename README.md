# bfs-using-vivado-hls
It remians a challenge to develop irregular applications like graph processing algorithms
on FPGA using high level synthesis tools. In this work, we take BFS as an example to explore 
the use of SDAccel for irregular applications. In particular, channels and data flows with 
undeterministic amount of data are investigated in the examples.
